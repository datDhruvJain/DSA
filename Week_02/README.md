Further, implement a separate program (in C or C++) for each of the following problems
using your stack implementation (you may have to alter your stack implementations
accordingly).
(a) Write a program to print the contents of an integer array in reverse order.
(b) Check whether the given parenthesized arithmetic expression has balanced
parenthesis or not, assuming the expression to have parenthesis types (), {}, or
[]. You may assume the input expression to be composed of constructs
operators, operands and parentheses where each construct is a character.
(c) Evaluate a given postfix expression for a given value assignment. The
expression is composed of operators (‘+’,’-’,’*’,’ /’, or ‘^’) or single character
operands (characters A to Z alone). Your procedure should read the expression,
value of each operand from the user, compute result (error message if in case
the expression is an invalid postfix expression), and output the result.
